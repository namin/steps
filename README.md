STEPS
=====

A [code study](https://github.com/namin/steps/tree/master/oecm) of _open,
extensible composition models_
([PDF](http://piumarta.com/freeco11/freeco11-piumarta-oecm.pdf)) in Clojure.

In retrospect and in the spirit of [maru](http://piumarta.com/software/maru/), it would have been much more interesting to bootstrap from a spartan host instead of Clojure.
